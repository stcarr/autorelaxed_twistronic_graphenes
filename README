Autorelaxed Twistronic Graphenes:

Use "twistronic_graphene_bands_basic.m" as a demo script of calculating the electronic structure of
1: Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG)
2: Monolayer-on-Bilayer Graphene (MBG)
3: Alternating-Twist Trilayer Graphene (ATTG)

Unrelaxed calculations can be used "out of the box", just set params.relax_str = 0
For relaxed calculations, you will need the "relax_data" directory, which is not maintened on this git repo.
Contact Stephen to get a copy of the relaxed data (for TBG only, but can use for the other two structures and its an "ok" approximation).
